# ECSE439AssignmentTwo

Code written in Acceleo. Will intake feature and goal models written in jUCMNav and perform a model transformation with the resulting output being an overview of the system and how all of the elements of the feature and goal models are alligned.

To run the application, one should find the generate.mtl file which is located inside src/ECSE439AssignPtOne/common, right click on the file and open up run configurations. From there one should set the Main class to be ECSE439AssignPtOne.common.Generate, the model to be the jUCM diagram they wish to run the algorithm on and the target to be the location of in which they want to place the text file. This will result in a .txt file which will host the output of the Acceleo algorithm.
